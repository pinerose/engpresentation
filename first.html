                In the textbook, Christopher Columbus tried to find <br>
                the route to India to get black pepper. <br>
                However, it is well known that Isabel I supported him. <br>
                because he just wanted to seize enormous wealth and she knew that, <br>
                their is no reason for her to support him.<br>

                Until Adam smith wrote the wealth of nations, <br>
                the economic policy governing European society was mercantilism. <br>
                From a mercantilism point of view, when the country has lots of gold, <br>
                there is much currency, and it will be used to build up the national power. <br>
                This is utilized to bring lots of gold. <br>
                This is the virtuous circle of national wealth and national power.<br>

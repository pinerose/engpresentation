                If every country thinks at the mercantilism point of view, <br>
                every country should ban to import complete product and to export raw materials. <br>
                But if this kinds of situation really happens, <br>
                every country cannot export complete product, <br>
                so efficiency of international economy is decreased.<br>

                And when the country has lots of gold, the price of product is increased <br>
                and other country donâ€™t import their product, so there is no virtuous circle.<br>
